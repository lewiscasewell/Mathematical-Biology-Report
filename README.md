# Mathematical-Biology-Report
Python script for analysing fish population's during Brexit. 

This report aimed to formulate an appropriate model to avoid overfishing in British waters; a common issue faced by countries that set fishing quotas and policies. Out of the three mathematical fish-harvesting models that this report analyses, the recommended model is a logistic growth model with harvesting and predation. Due to the likely nature of fish populations confronting a predator, it is highly important that predation is considered to avoid overfishing. Economic analysis is performed to understand positive effects of the price per fish and availability of stock, as well as the negative effects of increased costs of effort and predation. It can be concluded that the third model analysed in this report is a viable option for reducing the risk of overfishing whilst maintaining economic profit. Since the model is being newly introduced, the simplicity in the model can be favourable. Then, more complexity can be added to the model once sufficient data is presented.
